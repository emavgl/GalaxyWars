GalaxyWars
==============
GalaxyWars is a terminal-game developed in April 2014 for the Programmazione1’s Exam. 
GalaxyWars’s goal was to develop a project that can prove all the skills that i have learned about C++ (Object Oriented Programming, Overloading, Overiding, Multiple inheritance and others). 
GalaxyWars is based on the idea of Konquest. First of all you have to choose a map with a set number of planets.
After this you have to manage your planets to to conquer all the planets of the enemy.
It isn’t a very simple thing because computer hasn’t trivial algorithms.
